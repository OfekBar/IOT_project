Final project for a third-year, IOT workshop. We created a manegement app for a "Smart Fridge", allowing users to track their storage, 
easily maintain a shopping list and even get recommandations on what to eat for lunch!
Our platforms inclluded Microsoft Azure and Xamarin. 
The app runs on IOS devices. Screenshots of the app and a webpage with in-depth explanations can be found in the "website" folder of this repository.
